# GitHub suspends cron-based workflows for "inactivity" when there hasn't been
# new commits in the repo in 60 days.  This results in breaking workflows on
# static sites which don't need to be updated very regularly.
# 
# This workflow puts a bandaid on that nuisance by generating a dummy commit,
# when needed, to avoid the repo getting flagged for "inactivity".
